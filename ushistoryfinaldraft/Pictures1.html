										<h2>How pictures reflected the tension 
										between British and the colonists</h2>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>This is a political cartoon that shows Bostonians captured in a metal cage that hangs on a tree that has “Liberty Tree” inscribed on it. Under the cage is a small boat with several sailors and a basket of fish on it. The sailors are feeding the Bostonians fish. One of the Bostonians holds a paper that says: “They tried with the Lord in their trouble & he saved them out of their Distress.” There are also many cannons under the cage and several huge ships on the horizon. (Digital Public Library of America 1774) </p>
									<p>The cartoon was published in Britain, and it shows how the British mocked that the American colonists who dumped the British tea were caged by their pursuit of freedom. However, under the influence of the Enlightenment thinkers, the American colonists believed that freedom was their n¬¬¬atural right. Therefore their pursuit of freedom, which was to dump the British Tea, was justified. How the sailors fed the Bostonian fish reflected the British’s thought that the colonists needed the help of the empire. In fact, there was a conflict that the British government thought that “no government could exist in a colony without a grant of the power from the crown” while Americans thought they could make a government by themselves. (Jensen 1957, 325) This conflict is essentially the conflict between Britain’s seek of control and the colony's pursuit of liberty. </p>

									<p>In this cartoon, a woman is restrained by several people while a doctor forces her to drink tea. There’s a paper that says “Boston Port Bill” in the doctor’s packet. Figures representing different countries are watching. In the distance, Boston is cannoned. (Digital Public Library of America 1774) The woman in the center represents America. How the woman is restrained shows that the British thought that America was not able to resist because Britain was much more powerful. British people’s belief that they were superior conflicted with the colonists’ ideology that all men are equal.</p>
									<p>The cartoon also reflected the thought that the Boston Port Act would make the colonists pay for their rebellion, as the British thought that the colonists’ revolt was guilty because they were supposed to be under the control of the empire. This is opposed to the colonists’ ideology that they should rebel because the empire broke the social contract. We could tell that both pictures reflect that the difference in the ideologies led to the tensions between the two groups. </p>
