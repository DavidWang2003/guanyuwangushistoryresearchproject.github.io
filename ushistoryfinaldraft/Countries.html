										<h2>Although Enlightenment was mostly associated with Britain and France, ideals from countries throughout Europe had an impact on the American Revolution. </h2>
									<h3>The Italian Enlightenment and Beccaria <h3>
									<p>The Italian Revolution spread Republicanism in the colonies. Pasquale Paoli, who was a Corsican leader, inspired many American leaders because the Corsican Republic was a representative democracy. This inspired the demand for representation in the American colonies and therefore caused the colonists’ hatred towards taxation without representation.  Beccaria, with its concept of proportionality, impacted the American laws, including the Bill of Rights. The Declaration of Independence and other important documents of America came from Beccaria’s belief that law should be written and enforced. In his On Crimes and Punishments, Beccaria expressed his anti-tyrannical beliefs. He thinks that laws should be made to maximize the happiness of men and work in the favor of most people instead of the rulers. (Bessler 2017) </p>
									<p>As the tyrannical British laws were making them miserable, the colonists felt miserable because their happiness wasn't maximized. The colonists then used Beccaria’s anti-tyrannical ideas that laws should be made for the people to justify their rebellion against Britain because the parliament didn’t consider the interest of the colonists when making the laws. The colonists were also eager for the representative democracy promoted by Pasquale Paoli because they were not represented in the parliament. Those Italian Enlightenment ideas supported the colonists’ dissatisfaction with Britain. </p> 
									<h3>The Irish Enlightenment and Jonathan Swift <h3>
									<p>Swift thought that Ireland was too reliant on British imports, and Britain's fiscal-military state was detrimental to Ireland's economy. In the years before the revolution, American colonists also felt that they relied too heavily on British imports and they were too heavily taxed because of the Seven Years War, so they shared Swift’s concern. (Moore 2017) Therefore, Swift also became a symbol of resistance to the empire. His books were present in libraries during the period before the revolution, and they showed the colonists that the debate of whether the Parliament should legislate the colonies already took place in Ireland in the 1720s. Swift’s work, which taught the colonists how to solve these economic and constitutional problems, was an ideological origin of the revolution.  </p> 
									<h3>Ideologies from the English Civil war  <h3>
									<p>The ideas from the English Civil war, quickly spread by pamphlets and newspapers, gave rise to the debate of Britain's jurisdiction power. (Bernard 1992)The colonists, knowing that the rules of Parliament were debatable, argued that the Parliament imposed unfair tax and used it as justification for their radical ideas. The prevalent ideologies at the time would benefit America and eventually produce a government that follows these ideologies.</p>
