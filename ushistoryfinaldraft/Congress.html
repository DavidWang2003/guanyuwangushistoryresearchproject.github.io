										<h2>Natural Rights Theory and Social Contract Theory</h2>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>The Natural Rights Theory, which originated in the late eighteenth century and was supported by Enlightenment thinkers such as Thomas Hobbes, had a tremendous impact on America in the seventeenth century. (Cohen 1978, 497) One of the purposes of establishing the continental congress was under the influence of this theory. This purpose was to ensure that the colonists’ natural rights, such as liberty, were not subverted by Britain.</p>
									<p>To deal with Britain’s violations of their rights and defend themselves using the Natural Rights Theory, the colonists established the first continental congress. In “Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress”, the colonists listed ten legal rights that should belong to them and suggested that they didn’t have those rights. Those rights emphasized liberty and life, which were natural rights that were strongly advocated by Enlightenment thinkers. (Reck 1977, 95) One example of their rights being violated was how Britain troops stayed in America after the Battle of Lexington and Concord, which threatened the colonists’ rights, which is an important right. How the colonists created the congress because of Britain’s violation of their rights shows the Enlightenment ideals induced the disagreement between the colonists and the British parliament. </p>
									<p>In the eighteenth century, John Locke's Ideologies “had grown luxuriantly” in America. (Joyce 1978, 936) One of Locke’s most famous theories is the social contract theory. This theory states that people give their rights to the government in exchange for the government’s assistance and protection. The second continental congress justified their armed protest against Britain in 1775 with the social contract theory. </p>
									<p>In  “Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking up Arms”, the second continental congress argued that the colonists needed to take up arms against Britain due to their inhumane policies and ignorance of the colonists’ pleads. Justifying their rebellion, the continental criticized Britain and suggested that they didn’t follow the social contract: “…government was instituted to promote the welfare of mankind…the legislature of Great-Britain, however…effect their cruel and impolitic purpose of enslaving those colonies by violence…”. For the continental congress, Britain’s legislature, which intended to forcefully control the colonies, did not reflect the principle of the government, which was to help the colonies. According to John Locke’s theory, this means that the British king broke the social contract with his subjects in America, and thus the colonists’ rebellions were justified. (Lokken 1974, 85) Realizing that Britain broke the social contract, the continental congress argued that they too didn’t have to follow the contract and give their rights to Britain, so they started their rebellion.</p>
