									<h2>History of the constitutional relationship between the legislative authority in Britain and the colonies</h2>
									<p>In the period between 1689 and 1763, this relationship was unsettled. Although the Crown officials attempted to establish a constitution for the colonies, these rules were not really enforced on the colonies in practice due to several factors. The Crown officers felt that the constitution in the colonies was “uncertain”.   </p>
									<p>In the 1720s, the colonists already thought that the constitution was “imperfect” at the time and they wanted the privileges that the British people had. At the time, the colonial governments handled internal affairs and the British government handled external affairs, and it was uncertain how much control Britain had on the colonies. Britain began to see how much power it had by imposing taxes on the colonies during 1764 and 1766, and it provoked questions about the constitutional relationship between Britain and the colonies. They began to have different opinions of how power should be distributed. However, few people in the colonies thought that they should be represented in the parliament at this period. </p>
									<p>In the period of 1767 to 1773, with the Townshend Acts, radical thinkers began to question whether the parliament should have control over the colonies. Britain was worried that exploring its constitutional relationship with the colonies would damage the structure of the empire. The colonists began to realize the importance of setting up boundaries and even making their own constitutions. The colonial leaders thought that the local government should have the ultimate authority over local matters, and the colonists showed this idea by doing political protests. </p>
									<p>The period of 1774 to 1776 shattered the empire. The parliament thought it should be the supreme sovereign of the empire, the colonists formed the Continental Congresses to call for complete autonomy.(Greene 2011)</p>
									<h2> How does the US Constitution relate to the colonists’ ideologies? </h2>
									<p>The US Constitution reflects the difference in ideologies between the colonies and Britain, which ultimately led to the revolution. The fact that the constitution is filled with Enlightenment ideologies(seperation of power, democracy, etc..) shows the huge impact of those ideologies on the conflict between the two sides.</p>
